The idea of this capstone project is to help those people to know the best location in London to have a good revenue at the end. The problem that they face is the big area of London which has 8 different areas as following: South East, South West, West, North, East Central, East, West Central, and North West.\n### At the end of this project, I will determine for them the best area (which one of the 8 areas of London) to be used in London, then I will explore the neighborhoods of that best area in order to have a view of the venue categories and determine the group or groups of neighborhoods to open the restaurant.\n",

From the Foursquare data I will take into consideration the top common venues in that area, and this can be implemented through frequency statistics and aggregations per area and derive the distributions per area and per venue category. At that point we had to choose the best area of London and we selected the area with the minimum number of restaurants and this will be implemented in two stages the first stage is to selected the top 20 restaurants in the area and the next stage is to select the top 10 restaurant then I will proceed in K-means clustering method in order to group our neighborhoods into 5 clusters based on the venues nearby. Geospatial map view will be used to represent the results. \n### The last step is exploring the derived clusters to choose the cluster that there is a probable opportunity to open restaurant after determining the optimal neighborhood based on the least percentage of restaurants and the distance between the new restaurant to other restaurants in the area and other entertainment venues nearby if any.\n",
